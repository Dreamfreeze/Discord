,"b""New Xbox Series X Chip Reportedly In Development, But Don't Expect Better Performance""","b'Tue, 12 Apr 2022 07:38:00 -0700'","b'<p>Microsoft has reportedly begun work on an improved chip for the Xbox Series X console. According to journalist Brad Sams, the new chip is claimed to be smaller, more power-efficient, and could lead to a lower cost of production.</p><p>""I believe this is true--I know that Microsoft was working on revisions of the chip,"" Sams said on his <a href=""https://youtu.be/BwbLg18kqrg"">YouTube channel</a> (as transcribed by <a href=""https://www.purexbox.com/news/2022/04/microsoft-reportedly-working-on-smaller-more-power-efficient-series-x-chip"">Pure Xbox</a> and at around the 25:50 mark). ""Now, are we going to see performance improvements, are we going to see anything else? I do not believe so but Microsoft is always working on making cooler, more efficient chips because that lowers the cost of production. I believe it is accurate that Microsoft is working on a smaller, more power-efficient chip. That is, I\'m very confident in that.""</p><p>A smaller chip likely won\'t mean a slimmer version of the Xbox Series X, this early into its life-cycle. For comparison, the Xbox 360 Slim was released five years after the original console, and the Xbox One S arrived three years after the launch of the Xbox One. It\'s also unclear if the chip could be used as part of a mid-cycle console refresh. It\'s more likely that the revision would be strictly internal and leave the current Xbox Series X shape unchanged, similar to how <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-ps5-model-reportedly-has-a-smaller-heatsink-and-runs-a-bit-hotter/1100-6495718/"">Sony\'s revised PS5</a> features a smaller and lighter heatsink while retaining its unique design.</p><p>As for the future, Microsoft confirmed last year that <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-already-developing-new-xbox-hardware/1100-6492634/"">new Xbox hardware is currently in development</a>, although we won\'t see it for quite some time. ""Cloud is key to our hardware and Game Pass roadmaps,"" Liz Hamren, Microsoft\'s CVP of Gaming Experiences and Platforms, said at the time. ""But no one should think we\'re slowing down on our core console engineering. In fact, we\'re accelerating it. We\'re already hard at work on new hardware and platforms, some of which won\'t come to light for years.""</p><p>Despite an ongoing supply shortage, the Xbox Series X and its smaller Series S sibling have managed to sell well since they were launched in November 2020. As of January this year, analysts estimated that the Xbox Series X|S consoles combined to ship <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-reaches-12-million-shipped-analyst-says/1100-6499507/"">12 million units since launch globally.</a></p><div data-embed-type=""imageGallery"" data-ref-id=""3960""></div>'",b'https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-series-x-chip-reportedly-in-development-but-dont-expect-better-performance/1100-6502396/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f',https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1601/16018044/3963429-xsx-internal.jpg

,"b""The Isle Of Bigsnax Is More Bugsnax And That's All I Need""","b'Tue, 12 Apr 2022 06:00:00 -0700'","b'<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/bugsnax/"">Bugsnax</a> is finally coming to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Xbox Game Pass, and Nintendo Switch on April 28 after being only available for PS5, PS4, and PC. That same day, the game will also receive its first major content update, The Isle of Bigsnax. The expansion is a free update.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Ahead of its release, I got to see what\'s in store for Bugsnax when The Isle of Bigsnax launches. In short, it\'s largely more of what the experience is like playing the base game. Sure, The Isle of Bigsnax offers new activities to do and a brand-new story campaign, but the experience is pretty much just more of what we\'ve already got.</p><p dir=""ltr"">And honestly, that\'s 100% fine with me. I sadly didn\'t get to actually play the new expansion, so take what I say with a grain of salt--I can only base my opinion on observations, not first-hand experience. But what I saw looks a lot like what it\'s like to play Bugsnax, which is a great game, as described in GameSpot\'s <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bugsnax-review-delicious-and-nutritious/1900-6417606/"">Bugsnax review</a>.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In The Isle of Bigsnax, you travel to Broken Tooth--a strange island where Bugsnax grow to enormous size. Chandlo, Floofty, Triffany, and Shelda all join you on this new adventure, with everyone working together to uncover the mysteries of the island. There\'s an underlying implication that perhaps something sinister is afoot, or at the very least, there\'s more to this island than just bigger Bugsnax.</p><p dir=""ltr"">""A large focus in this set of quests is the conflict between Floofty and Shelda especially, but also there is a lot with Chandlo\'s relationships with Snorpy in a moment where they are not around each other for a long time, as well as Triffany worrying about working in a group setting because she is very used to working alone,"" Bugsnax creative director Kevin Zuhn said during a Q&amp;A at the preview. ""Those are the major themes each of the characters are going through.""</p><p dir=""ltr"">""[The island] is one large level that is pretty open to explore,"" Bugsnax programmer and producer Kevin Geisler said at that same Q&amp;A. ""It\'s significantly larger than the other levels in the game.""</p><p dir=""ltr"">Uncovering more of the story requires you to complete errands for your fellow grumpuses. You need to help them out, solving environmental puzzles and figuring out how to skirt around obstacles by observing and scanning the local wildlife. Scanning Bugsnax provides insight into their likes and dislikes, allowing you to take advantage of their unique behaviors to solve certain puzzles.</p><p dir=""ltr"">From what I saw, the process of using Bugsnax to your advantage or catching them plays out much like what we\'re familiar with--using bait and your assortment of items to attract, stun, and trap your prey. But given that the Bugsnax on Broken Tooth are significantly larger in size, they are used in new types of environmental puzzles, like knocking down walls that are blocking your path or serving as a springboard to platform up to a previously unreachable cliff. Catching them can prove trickier too, as you seemingly need to always find a way to shrink them down in order to trap them.</p><p dir=""ltr"">If you\'re a new, wannabe fan, don\'t worry--you can jump into the expansion even if you haven\'t finished Bugsnax. Narratively, the story of The Isle of Bigsnax occurs just prior to the ending of the game. So if you haven\'t finished Bugsnax and have yet to uncover the final narrative threads, this expansion won\'t spoil things for you.</p><video data-embed-type=""video"" data-ref-id=""2300-6456560"" data-src=""/videos/bugsnax-the-isle-of-bigsnax-update-playstation-state-of-play-2021/2300-6456560/"" data-width=""854"" data-height=""480"" data-video-start=""0""></video><p dir=""ltr"">""In some ways, it actually puts [players] in a state to be more ready for the end game in the first place,"" Zuhn said. He added that he feels like there are gaps in Bugsnax story that needed to be filled--The Isle of Bigsnax addresses that concern, providing additional insight into the game\'s central mystery.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Because it takes place so late in the campaign, you\'ll actually have to play quite a bit of Bugsnax to access The Isle of Bigsnax. ""In order to begin the quest, you have to complete Snorpy\'s side quest; then he will approach you with this quest available,"" Zuhn said. ""At which point, you\'ll also have to complete the side quests of the other characters who are involved. So this takes place after each of them has had that particular sort of quest state and character development. So it is fairly late in the game, but if you\'ve already completed everything, it\'ll just be available right away.""</p><p dir=""ltr"">A new fast travel feature means you can easily go back and forth between Bugsnax\'s Snaktooth Island and the new Broken Tooth. And there\'s plenty of new stuff to do back on Snaktooth. The expansion adds new mail quests, where you can approach your newly added mailbox and find requests from your fellow grumpuses. Accomplishing these tasks earns you cosmetic items that can be used to decorate your new hut, which also gets added in The Isle of Bigsnax.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Amusingly, it looks like the cadence of new letters is dependent on who you\'ve met and how far you\'ve gotten in the campaign. So if you\'re just jumping into Bugsnax for the first time on April 28, you\'ll seemingly be getting letters at a fairly normal pace. However, it seems that players who have already beaten Bugsnax or at least poured a lot of time into it can expect to see their new mailbox absolutely chock-full of messages. It was comical to see the developers fast-forward the preview build to a later point in the game and then get dozens of letters all at once. The tasks denoted in the letters are reminiscent of tasks given to you in the base game--finding certain Bugsnax, feeding the grumpuses specific Bugsnax, etc.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The final big addition of the expansion is hats. In a loose variation of the process of shiny hunting in Pokemon, there are now one-of-a-kind unique Bugsnax out in the world for you to find--they\'re not any different in design in comparison to their brethren, other than an especially cute adornment upon their heads. Capturing said critter will unlock the hat they are wearing, which you can use to dress up the captured Bugsnax donated to Gramble\'s ranch. It seems like a nice distraction to look out for while accomplishing mail quests--not something I\'m looking forward to, but I know plenty of completionists who will enjoy the process of acquiring every available hat.</p><p dir=""ltr"">According to Zuhn, The Isle of Bigsnax\'s campaign will take around three to four hours to complete. The time needed to find all of the collectibles and complete all of the mail quests will depend on your skill level, though Zuhn predicts that this DLC adds about 80% more content to Bugsnax. So it doesn\'t quite double the amount of side content to do, but it\'s pretty close.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Even if The Isle of Bigsnax isn\'t adding anything fundamentally fresh to Bugsnax\'s formula, the new story, mail activities, hut decorating, and hat collecting all seem to expand upon the best aspects of the core gameplay loop. And as plenty of folks can tell you, Bugsnax has a great formula--one that seems well worth jumping back into for a few hours.</p>'",b'https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-isle-of-bigsnax-is-more-bugsnax-and-thats-all-i-need/1100-6502388/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f',https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1587/15875866/3963206-bugnsax-bigsnax-dlc-pc.jpg

A Big Piece Of Land""","b'Tue, 12 Apr 2022 05:32:00 -0700'","b'<p>2022 is the year of gaming acquisitions, and that continues today, with Nintendo spending 5,000,000,000 Yen (about $40 million USD) to acquire... a big piece of land.</p><p>The company <a href=""https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2022/220412.html"">announced</a> it is buying the land adjacent to its headquarters in Kyoto, Japan. The land was previously owned by the city and was where the former Foundation Support Factor and former Material and Disaster Prevention Center was located.</p><p>The site is located at <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/search/11-2-5+Hokotate-cho,+Kamitoba,+Minami-ku,+Kyoto,+Japan/@34.9678323,135.7455199,16z/data=!3m1!4b1"">11-2-5 Hokotate-cho, Kamitoba, Minami-ku, Kyoto, Japan</a>, and it measures 10,028.55\xe3\x8e\xa1 in size.</p><p>Nintendo will use the land to create a second Corporate Headquarters Development Center.

,b'MLB The Show 22 Diamond Dynasty Tips And Tricks',"b'Mon, 11 Apr 2022 15:43:00 -0700'","b'<p> Diamond Dynasty is the card-based mode in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/mlb-the-show-22/"">MLB The Show 22</a> where you collect cards and try to build the best baseball team possible. While this mode certainly favors players willing to spend a little money, there are ways to put together a top team by just playing the game. Here are a few tips to help build out your dream team in Diamond Dynasty.</p><h2 dir=""ltr"">How to find the best deals on the marketplace</h2><p dir=""ltr"">One of the most important parts of Diamond Dynasty is the marketplace, where other players are selling their cards for stubs. While buying packs of cards is certainly cheaper, you know what you\'re getting through the marketplace. It\'s important to know how to find a good deal, because unless you\'re willing to break the bank, you probably aren\'t spending a few hundred thousand stubs to get a top-tier Mike Trout card. Instead, you will want to use the filters to narrow down the options.</p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Here, you can punch in the minimum and maximum player rating and cost, along with positions and other filters. Knowing how many stubs you\'re willing to spend, what position you need, and what a good bump in ratings is, you can set filters appropriately. The best way to maximize your stubs is to make sure you are getting a significant enough boost in rating. If your third basemen is an 80, it\'s probably not worth picking up another third basemen below an 85. Once you set your filters, look for lower cost players. You won\'t have a team filled with recognizable superstars, but you will have a solid team to continue playing Diamond Dynasty and earn more stubs.</span></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Always pick Sell Now over Quick Sell</h2><p dir=""ltr"">Diamond Dynasty is all about opening packs of cards and adding the best players you can get to your roster. This also means getting a bunch of cards for players that you either don\'t need or have better players in that position. Since MLB The Show 22 is close to launch, many cards will have two options to sell the card, Sell Now or Quick Sell. The Sell Now option means there is someone on the marketplace looking to pick up the card and the amount of Stubs you will receive is higher than the Quick Sell option. The upside to Quick Sell is that option is always available, but take the better price whenever possible.</p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Know what the general rating of your players is</h2><p dir=""ltr"">Creating the best Diamond Dynasty team possible means opening a ton of player packs and looking at a ton of cards. To save yourself some time and headache, it\'s a good idea to have a general idea of what player rating your squad has. If you know off-hand that every pitcher in your rotation has above a 70 rating, you don\'t need to bother checking the stats of a starting pitcher card you just got that has a 65 rating. While the exact stats will matter as you hit the higher ratings, when just starting out you are almost always better off taking the better rated player.</p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Check out Mini Seasons, but don\'t expect it to be easy</h2><p dir=""ltr"">One of the best ways to <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-earn-stubs-fast-in-mlb-the-show-22/1100-6502138/"">earn Stubs quickly</a> is to win some Mini Seasons, where your Diamond Dynasty team gets put up against a set of teams in a miniature season. You play brief, three inning games in a shortened season, which allows you to progress through programs and earn Stubs quickly. This is also one of the least complicated single-player Diamond Dynasty modes, as its regular baseball, just shorter. The only downside to jumping into this mode with your fresh-faced squad is that the other teams are going to have better players. Unless you feel like busting out your wallet, you will need to grind out some Stubs.</p><h2 dir=""ltr"">Check out showdown mode for a boost in Stubs</h2><p dir=""ltr"">Showdown mode is another way to rack up some stubs and get to use some of the better player cards in the game without actually having them. Each Showdown has a series of challenges that you must complete, before battling in a final Showdown. Players draft a team to start and earn bonus cards and perks whenever they successfully complete a challenge. The only downside to Showdown is that there is an entry fee to start one and if you do poorly enough, you could come out down stubs on the other side.</p>'",b'https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-22-diamond-dynasty-tips-and-tricks/1100-6502386/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f',https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1599/15997278/3963194-mlbts22_screenshot_xboxseriesx_002.png

,b'Elden Ring - How To Beat The Elden Beast',"b'Mon, 11 Apr 2022 12:53:00 -0700'","b'<p>You\'ve finally taken down <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-how-to-beat-radagon/1100-6502335/"">Radagon</a>. Congratulations! Defeating him is no easy feat. Unfortunately, his fight--which could easy stand alone as one of the toughest encounters in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/"">Elden Ring</a> on its own--is really just phase one. Now it\'s time for phase two. Meet: The Elden Beast, servant to the Greater Will and the true form of the Elden Ring itself.</p><p>Whereas Radagon is a test of timing and reflex, the Elden Beast is a test of endurance. With one of the most massive health bars in From Software history, it can feel like there\'s no end in sight, and knowing that you have to beat Radagon all over again just to get back to the arena can lead to particularly demoralizing defeats. But fear not! Once you learn the most dangerous attacks to look out for--and how to avoid them--you\'ll come out victorious in no time.</p><h2><b>What to know before going in</b></h2><p>Basically all the advice for preparing for the Radagon fight remains true for the Elden Beast. You\'ll want to be at a high level (somewhere in the 150 range to be safe), with at least 40 points invested into Vigor. Get your weapon leveled up as much as possible to maximize damage and shorten the duration of the encounter--the less time you spend fighting, the fewer chances there will be to get caught in one of its devastating attacks.</p><p>Just like Radagon, the Elden Beast has multiple attacks that deal Holy Damage. Stock up on Holyproof Dried Livers or equip Lord\'s Divine Fortification for some extra protection.</p><p>Don\'t forget to bring along your favorite Spirit Summon (<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-mimic-tear-where-to-get-this-powerful-spirit-ash-and-why-you-should/1100-6501311/"">Mimic Tear</a> and Black Knife Tiche being the best of the bunch). Again, in a fight as long as this, anything you can do to make it go by faster is highly valuable. Doubling your damage output with a Summon is a great way to do just that. Remember, any damage taken by your Summon during the Radagon fight will carry over here, if it makes it out alive at all. If you\'re confident enough against Radagon, wait until the Elden Beast to ring your bell.</p><h2><b>How to beat the Elden Beast</b></h2><p>The Elden Beast is a massive, cosmic monstrosity with a full arsenal of attacks as epic as you\'d expect from the final boss in Elden Ring. It\'s helpful to approach the fight similarly to the various dragons you\'ve encountered throughout your journey. Get comfortable unlocking and locking on throughout the fight, be ready to close the gap when the Elden Beast flies away, and always be on the lookout for its many huge AOE attacks that can potentially one-shot you from full health.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no real easy cheese method to this fight. The Elden Beast is immune to all status effects, and strong against all elemental damage (it even <i>heals </i>from Holy Damage, so avoid that at all costs). Its only real weakness is a glowing gold spot on its stomach, so always direct your hits there when possible (this is also where you can get off a Critical Attack if you manage to break its Stance). If you\'re running a melee-centric build, simply use whatever weapon can maximize your damage output and smack away for as long as it takes. For mages, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-where-to-get-rock-sling/1100-6502297/"">Rock Sling</a> is likely your best bet.</p><image data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463645/3963166-img_9673.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-3963166"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""1280"" data-resize-url=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1746/17463645/3963166-img_9673.jpg"" data-resized=""true"">Weak spot on the Elden Beast\'s stomach</image><p>If you\'re going to use a shield, make sure it has as high of Holy Damage resistance as possible (the Haligtree Crest Greatshield being the best of the bunch in this regard). However, given the massive AOE and huge posture damage many of its attacks can dish out, blocking probably isn\'t your best bet. You\'ll be better served dodging through its sword swipes and projectiles, and learning where to position yourself to avoid taking damage from its AOE effects.</p><p>These are the most important attacks to look out for in phase one:</p><h3>First Phase</h3><ul><li>Yellow flame breath. It will always start the fight with this move. Run up to get in a hit or two on its glowing gold stomach, then quickly get behind it to avoid the flames it will spew over a large area in front of it. Swing away on its tail until the attack ends.</li><li>Its sword will start to glow gold before slamming it in the ground, followed by a massive explosion when it pulls it out. Roll through first blast, then get behind it to avoid the bigger follow-up AOE. Get in some hits on its tail in the meantime.</li><li>A grab attack. When a glowing gold orb appears around its hand, get some distance to avoid the incoming grab. It will bombard you with projectiles if it manages to get a hold of you.</li><li>Purple cloud. Whenever a star-spotted purple mist appears, get away from it as fast as possible! It will explode seconds later. The Elden Beast can shoot this at you from a distance, or up close, which can be tougher to avoid.</li><li>Rune Arc projectiles. Its sword will start to glow, then it will shoot four Rune Arc-shaped projectiles at you. The first two happen back to back, so roll, then roll again immediately after. The third and fourth come with a bit of a delay. Practice getting the timing down to roll through these as well.</li><li>Homing stars. It will swim underwater, then fly back up with its wings spread and shoot a series of homing stars at you. To avoid them, simply run in straight ahead in one direction until the attack ends. Unlocking your camera can help here, but be on the lookout for a follow-up attack.</li><li>Elden Ring blast. It will begin to glow, then fly up above the arena, forming the Elden Ring in the sky. You\'ll find yourself in the middle of a ring on the ground quickly closing in, along with another ring outside of it. Run away, jumping over the enclosing ring before it reaches the center and releases a massive AOE explosion. You\'ll avoid damage if you make it out of the outer ring\'s radius in time.</li></ul><p>In addition to all of these attacks in phase one, the Elden Beast will bombard you with various slams and sword swipe combinations, all the while swimming away and reappearing on the other side of the arena. Its sword attacks are easy enough to dodge through once you get the timing down. Be on the lookout for its various ranged attacks when you\'re closing the distance after it retreats.</p><p>Phase two is essentially the same as phase one, but with a few deadly new attacks:</p><h3>Second phase</h3><ul><li>Wave of Gold. It will charge its sword back, then fire a large, cone-shaped AOE blast ahead. Try to get behind it before it has a chance to fire off the spell, as it can do massive damage if connects.</li><li>The homing stars will be replaced with the Elden Stars incantation. In addition to smaller stars coming at you, there will be one large one slowly barreling your way as well. Again, run in a straight line away from the projectiles. You might take some damage from the smaller stars, but be sure to dodge out of the way of the big one to avoid getting hit.</li><li>The Elden Ring blast will now have three rings closing in on you instead of just one. Jump over all three, and get outside the outer ring in time to avoid the blast. It also likes to follow up with a Rune Arc projectile right after the explosion in phase two, so be ready to dodge as soon as you make it out of the ring.</li></ul><p>There\'s no way around it: This fight is a slog. But when you finally make it to the other side, you\'ll be rewarded with a whopping 500,000 runes. On top of that, it\'s finally time to choose your ending. You have officially beaten Elden Ring! Sit back, watch the credits roll, and bask in the glory of achieving what is sure to be one of the most monumental gaming accomplishments of your life.</p><div data-embed-type=""pinbox"" data-ref-id=""5455""></div>'",b'https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-how-to-beat-the-elden-beast/1100-6502380/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f',https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1746/17463645/3963116-eldenbeast.png
,"b'Huge Halo: MCC Update Adds Flood Firefight, Campaign Cross-Play For Halo 3 And ODST'","b'Mon, 11 Apr 2022 11:26:00 -0700'","b'<p>Updates for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-master-chief-collection/"">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> are slowing down as 343 shifts focus to <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/"">Halo Infinite</a>, but a big one out today delivers new and exciting features  to the compilation package. This is a very large update, coming in at around 21.5GB on Xbox, 26.5GB on Microsoft Store app or Xbox app on PC, and about 11.2GB on Steam.</p><p>The big-ticket items for the April 11 MCC patch include a new mode, Flood Firefight, as well as co-op crossplay support added to the campaigns for Halo 3 and ODST. What\'s more, MCC now has full custom game browser support, while there are a host of other updates and tweaks for the game.</p><image data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/3963089-flood.jpeg"" data-ref-id=""1300-3963089"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""1920"" data-resize-url=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1179/11799911/3963089-flood.jpeg"" data-resized=""true"">Flood Firefight comes to Halo: MCC</image><p>The new mode is Flood Firefight, which, as its name suggests, adds the evil Flood enemies to Firefight rounds. The Flood appear in Firefight with an eerie-looking fog element that dynamically fades in and out. Additionally, Flood can get into vehicles and they have new animations and abilities.</p><p>""ODSTs can be infected and resurrected by the Flood. Beware, as you may have to fight your own resurrected allies--or even yourself!"" 343 said.</p><p>Beyond that, 343 has added the ability to use the Energy Sword and Sentinel Beam in ODST for the first time, while players can now trade weapons with allies, too. What\'s more, weapon racks with assault rifles and battle rifles are now in Firefight to help players take down the Flood. Some maps have Flamethrowers, too, to help you deal with the enemies.</p><p>For campaign crossplay, PC and Xbox console players can now play Halo 3 and ODST cooperatively online. 343 said it needs your help to work through any issues, so it advises players to <a href=""https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036218972&amp;data=05|01|v-awakeford@microsoft.com|06f8bc4bffb1427df0da08da18d7aa33|72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47|1|0|637849611814309547|Unknown|TWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0=|3000|||&amp;sdata=ogVDXZVy5r5fVyWQiiA1YuTS+qE5YGeDF29zLB/oIq4=&amp;reserved=0"">submit bug report tickets</a> for any issues they might encounter.</p><p>Elsewhere, the April 11 MCC patch adds weapon customization for Halo 4\'s campaign. Players can assign skins to weapons so that when they pick them up, they\'ll see their unique customization. The special skin even applies to Marine allies if you trade weapons with one of the NPCs.</p><p>Another notable change is for Halo 3\'s medals. There are 51 new medals being added, including Headshot, Assist, Revenge, Grenade Kill, and many more. These achievements have always been tracked by Halo 3, but not always shown during matches. With this new update, players can toggle on Unified Medal Display to see all of these medals pop up in the HUD overlay. If this sounds like too much, players can select the ""Original+"" medal display setting to only show the original medals, as well as three of the most common new ones (Headshot, Assist, and Supercombine). There is also a new option to turn all medals off entirely.</p><p>The April 11 MCC patch also adds new features for the Custom Game Browser. Specifically, players can select ""automatic"" team changing. This allows a game host to avoid manual team changes, instead automatically ensuring the teams are even for each new match. This was already live in some games within MCC, but now it\'s available in all of them.</p><image data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/3963110-floodfight.jpeg"" data-ref-id=""1300-3963110"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""1920"" data-resize-url=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1179/11799911/3963110-floodfight.jpeg"" data-resized=""true"">It\'s a big day for Halo: MCC</image><p>The new MCC update also introduces more skulls, some of which have been labeled ""experimental."" That\'s because some of these new skulls may break the game, basically. 343 warned that players who use some of the new skulls run the risk of not being able to complete a given mission. Some of the new skulls for Halo 3 include ""Boom"" (increases explosion radius X2), ""Ghost,"" (AI doesn\'t flinch from attacks), and ""Anger"" (enemies shoot more, and faster).</p><p>Beyond this update, 343 said it has a number of new features and improvements in store for MCC down the road. This includes adding mod support for more games within the MCC package, adding additional cosmetics, introducing more campaign collectibles, optimizing the post-match screens, and introducing new accessibility features like better subtitle support, controller remapping, and ""additional campaign accessibility options.""</p><p>As announced previously, 343 is no longer supporting MCC on a seasonal basis, so it\'s not committing to a specific timeline for when future updates will arrive, though it said it expects this work to be complete by the end of 2022. After that, 343 said it will ""continue to engage with the community"" and dig back into MCC for updates and support ""as needed.""</p><p>You can see the full April 11 MCC patch notes below, <a href=""https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/update-on-halo-mcc"">as shared on the Halo website</a>. 343 also continues to update and support Halo Infinite, with its <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-season-2-start-date-new-modes-and-lone-wolves-battle-pass/1100-6502329/"">Season 2: Lone Wolves launch coming up on May 3</a>.</p><h2>Halo: MCC April 11 Patch Notes</h2><h2>HALO 3: ODST FIREFIGHT IMPROVEMENTS AND FLOODFIGHT</h2><ul><li>Various new settings are available when creating a Firefight session.

,b'New Apex Legends Update Finally Fixes Wattson On Storm Point',"b'Mon, 11 Apr 2022 11:22:00 -0700'","b'<p>Respawn has released a new update for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/"">Apex Legends</a>. The hotfix addresses an issue on Storm Point that has been plaguing Wattson, Rampart, and Pathfinder since the start of the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-brings-back-control-with-warriors-collection-event/1100-6501878/"">Warriors Collection Event</a>.</p><p dir=""ltr"">When the Warriors Collection Event went live on March 29, the accompanying update had the unforeseen side effect of suddenly making it unnecessarily difficult to use Wattson, Rampart, and Pathfinder\'s abilities that require placing an object while playing on Storm Point.</p><div data-embed-type=""tweet"" data-src=""https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1513573524765609985""><blockquote align=""center"" class=""twitter-tweet"" data-conversation=""none"" data-mce-disable-toolbar=""true""><p dir=""ltr"">Just pushed a <a href=""https://twitter.com/PlayApex?ref_src=twsrc^tfw"">@PlayApex</a> update to address: <br />-Issues with placeable abilities on Storm Point.<br />-Third-party controllers not working on Xbox Series X|S.<br />-Various next-gen console, Control, and Bangalore Story Event fixes.</p>  \xe2\x80\x94 Respawn (@Respawn) <a href=""https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1513573524765609985?ref_src=twsrc^tfw"">April 11, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p dir=""ltr"">This meant you could try to put down Rampart\'s Amped Wall on the ground or fire Pathfinder\'s Zipline Gun into a wall and the game would register normally fine placement spots as unavailable, preventing players from using these abilities.</p><p dir=""ltr"">This was an especially heavy, albeit unintentional, nerf towards Wattson whose <em>entire</em> kit is dependent on purposeful placement of her Perimeter Security tactical ability and Interception Pylon ultimate ability. Without reliable access to either, she\'s been basically unplayable on Storm Point for the entirety of the two-week event.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The hotfix also fixes issues connected to the The Williams Sendoff story event, as well as various issues with the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-versions-now-live/1100-6501968/"">PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of Apex Legends</a>.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The Warriors Collection Event ends tomorrow, April 12.
